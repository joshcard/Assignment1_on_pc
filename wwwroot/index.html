    <p>
        I hope to really understand ASP.NET MVC Core. I want to be able to go into a workplace and feel confident in my abilities,
        as well as be able to talk about the subject in an interview. I would also like to better understand git and github,
        seeing as working on a team is almost always the situation I will find myself in while in industry.
